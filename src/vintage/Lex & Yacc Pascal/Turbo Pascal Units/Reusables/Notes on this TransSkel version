Notes on this TransSkel versionIf you are familiar to TransSkel Pascal, you may find some calls in this version that you havn't seen before. TransEdit has become AppleEvent aware, for instance.Frankly, I had totally forgotten that I had made this new version! I'm not sure how well it works - if it does. It is sad, because it addresses some features that TransEdit needs. The approach is elegant enough: Through no effort of your own, any files dropped on the application are passed to you, as FSSpecs!No, an update to the archived version is not imminent. I don't use TransSkel that much any more, simply because I know the Mac so well that I don't need its "soft layer" but rather prefer to go straight down on the bare metal. Still, I may make an update, if nobody else does. But, if you like what you see here, feel free to have a go at the whole package to make a tested, updated version 2.7 (or whatever). Only, please… keep it simple, and keep it compatible.
