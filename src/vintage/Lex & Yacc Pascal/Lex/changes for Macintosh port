* changed "move" procedure calls to "lex_yacc_move_memory"  (attention : the parameters are now universal pointers  instead of untyped variables)* changed "getmem" procedure calls to "lex_yacc_get_memory"* changed the name of the "line" variables to "which_line"  to avoid a conflict with a graphical Macintosh routine called "line".* renamed the "size" function to "setsize"  to avoid conflict with a Macintosh type called "size"* changed all $IFDEF conditional macros to $IFC DEFINED* ditto for $IFNDEF  -->  $IFC UNDEFINED* ditto for $ELSE    -->  $ELSEC* ditto for $ENDIF   -->  $ENDC* changed all "exit" calls to "exit(name_of_function)"* changed all "inc(var,delta)" to "var := var + delta "* changed all "dec(var,delta)" to "var := var - delta "* moved unit body code of unit "lexopt" in a procedure  named "init_lex_opt" (attention : this procedure is  NOT called implicitely!)* moved unit body code of unit "lexmsg" in a procedure  named "init_lex_msg" (attention : this procedure is  NOT called implicitely!)* moved unit body code of unit "lextable" in a procedure  named "init_lex_table" (attention : this procedure is  NOT called implicitely!)* moved unit body code of unit "lexlib" in a procedure  named "init_lex_lib" (attention : this procedure is  NOT called implicitely!)* WHAT IS THE ABSOLUTE KEYWORD ????* changed all reset() and rewrite() calls to  lex_yacc_reset and lex_yacc_rewrite calls (attention :  the new functions take the file name as second parameter)* added a lex_yacc_get_file_size function, which does the real  job : the old file_size function just calls lex_yacc_get_file_size.* added two functions, lex_yacc_param_count and  lex_yacc_command_line_parameter, to do the job of the paramCount and  paramStr functions.* changed the val() function to lex_yacc_string_to_int().* changed the str() function to lex_yacc_int_to_string().* changed all "and" to "&"* changed all "or" to "|"* changed all "x mod y" operations to "abs(x) mod y"
